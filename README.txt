You can use this app to get more insight in how your Daikin Altherma Heat Pump is performing.

The information from your device is obtained over MQTT from an ESPAltherma device, so a working ESPAltherma device in your environment is required!

Two separate devices can be added to Homey, a Heat Pump and Water Tank device, giving you separate insights in their performance.

Please head over to the Homey Community Forum topic linked below for more information, How To's and support.
